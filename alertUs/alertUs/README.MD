AlertUs: 

This is an application developed in 48 hours during the Archhacks hackathon. The concept of the app is based around the idea of eliminating the stigma of mental health, in particular around young adults. The app itself serves to provide a community based first response in distressing situations. In it's current iteration, it can account for emotional and non-life threataning medical situations. Those with the app can be signed up as "responders", as patients, and as both. As far as emotional response, those who are in distressing situations can press a "distress" button, and have a responder(who has been positively rated by other emotionally distressed users), who is close by come by and console or help in any way they can.



The application uses firebase to let the iphones send and get alerts with the "patient" information for local responders (less than half a mile away).

The application is written in Swift using the Xcode native developers environment.
